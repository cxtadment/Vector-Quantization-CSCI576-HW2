Vector Quantization - HW2 of CSCI576
================

Key features
-------------
*Use Vector Quantization compress an image

Usage
-------------
*Step1: open the folder, then compile the program with --"javac VectorImage.java"
*Step2: run the program with the input as following -- "java VectorImage image1.raw 16"

*ps:(The program may takes a longtime, especially with few input of vectors, EX:N=4)
    (You can make the program run faster by changing the limit  of mean quantization error)
    (I've add an annotation "//change the mean quantization error here" above the source code of changing the limit)
